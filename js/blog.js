Weird lighting and mismatched furniture. the place was packed, as it took us a while to find a seat. I ordered a maple syrup latte and Chris ordered a machiatto. We both decided to try their famous fluffy waffles with pure maple syrup. We sat down at a rustic table with a wooden bench as we were served our waffle and drinks and my god, with the most beautiful presentation.'],

Tt was the most fluffy and moist waffle I\'ve ever eaten. My maple syrup latte tasted so fresh. It had the perfect amount of foam and it was at the perfect temperature. Chris also loved his machiatto.'],

Although we weren\'t exactly sure of what we were getting into, we set off for Locke Street on a chilly Sunday evening. We find parking, and walked up Locke passing familiar shops and restaurants until we found Democracy. We stepped in and found ourselves surrounded by floor to ceiling red curtains. We were then greeted by a waitress and told to order at the bar as we were just getting coffee.'],
